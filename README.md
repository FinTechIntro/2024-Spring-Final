# 2024-Spring-Final

## Research Criteria

After our first midterm exam, we have had several speakers join our class to discuss about recent research topics in finance technology. However, due to time limits, we could not go into detail on every topic. As a result, students are expected to research on a topic they are interested in within this field.

Check out the [issue](https://github.com/FinTechIntro/2024-Spring-Final/issues) section in this repository for a variety of research topics and resources. We've invited speakers to share their research ideas, which are posted as issues labeled with `topics`. Feel free to comment if you need more information on a topic or if the description isn't clear.

Feel free to explore a new topic related to finance technology that interests you. If you'd like feedback on your idea, just create an issue using the "Topics Request" template.

## Report Layout

For layout consistency, please follow either the [IEEE Transactions](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn) format or the [ACM paper](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty) format. You are free to use any text editor of your choice, such as Overleaf or Word. A sample project layout is provided [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09524). Your project must include the following sections: **Abstract**, **Introduction**, **Background**, **Conclusion**, and **Reference**. You can add additional sections between **Background** and **Conclusion** as needed. 

Please ensure that references are included in your project. Additionally, the first three sections, namely **Abstract**, **Introduction**, and **Background**, should not exceed 2 pages in total.

The paper should be between 4 to 6 pages in length, excluding the reference section. Please ensure that the paper does not exceed 6 pages.
